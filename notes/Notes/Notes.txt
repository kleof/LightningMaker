* issues: 
	missing "chunks" of line if line has too high width
	neon glow not looking too good with vertical lines
	glow not visible on white, could blendmodes help?
	something not quite right with child_length_min - shorter children are still spawning
	destroying instance holding start/end point crashes the game, should we do something about it?

- fade in newly created children/ animate/draw them from start to end /fading by darkening child color?
- fade out when child is about to die
- allow more instances to be added in visualizer?
- Default values for parameters

- less directional, more up and down main lightning movement
var base_noise = perlin_noise(noise_offset + x_offset * density, spd);
var secondary_noise = perlin_noise(r + x_offset * density , -spd);
var y_offset = base_noise * height * height_reduction * smoothing + (secondary_noise * height  + random(turbulence) * choose(-1,1)) * smoothing_secondary;

var base_noise = perlin_noise(noise_offset + x_offset * density, spd);
var secondary_noise = perlin_noise(r + x_offset * density , -spd);
var y_offset = base_noise * height *.5* height_reduction * smoothing + (secondary_noise * height * .5 + random(turbulence) * choose(-1,1)) * smoothing_secondary;

- dual color mode
glow_color = merge_color(c1, c2, i/num);

- children with different color(s)


- allow children's endpoint anywhere, on parents and other children, or maybe just on main branch?
- tween density? TweenFire(id, "ioQuad", 2, true, 0, 4, "density>", "@-.1");
- arch-like bend? +height(or additional param)*arc_curve?
- randomize each segment length?
- particles on end points (and slower, from line beam)

- preset shader uniforms

- object pooling - Precreate all potentially needed children and use them, instead of creating and destroying
unsure if impactful enough to implement?
