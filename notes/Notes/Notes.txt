- for drawing every n'th frame?

if (!surface_exists(my_surf)) {
   my_surf = surface_create();
   surface_set_target(my_surf);
   draw_stuff();
   surface_reset_target();
}

draw_surface(my_surf, x, y);


- use sprite (with round edges) instead of lines?

function draw_line_sprite(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2) {
    var _a    = point_direction(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2);
    var _d    = point_distance(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2);
    // 64 is the sprite's width and height
    draw_sprite_ext(sprite, 0, _x1, _y1, _d/64, 1/64, _a, color, 1);
}


- SPLIT draw() method to allow manual surface/shader setup, but make combined function for convenience too


- object pooling - Precreate all potentially needed children and use them, instead of creating and destroying
but does it matter, is it even impactful enough?


- check CleanShapes for line drawing to avoid gaps in lines of high width
