put bm_add in glow_set and remove from shaders stuff and line drawing

* issues: 
	naming
	missing "chunks" of line if line has too high width
	- check CleanShapes for line drawing to avoid gaps in lines of high width
	set surface size to match lightning area and not whole screen, will it help with performance?
	reduce number of parameters? or presets are enough?

- dual color mode
glow_color = merge_color(c1, c2, i/num);

- heart-beat rainbow
var color1 = make_color_hsv((current_time*0.2 % 255), 255, 255);

- drawing every n'th frame?

if (!surface_exists(my_surf)) {
   my_surf = surface_create();
   surface_set_target(my_surf);
   draw_stuff();
   surface_reset_target();
}

draw_surface(my_surf, x, y);


- use sprite (with round edges) instead of lines?

function draw_line_sprite(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2) {
    var _a    = point_direction(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2);
    var _d    = point_distance(_x1, _y1, _x2, _y2);
    // 64 is the sprite's width and height
    draw_sprite_ext(sprite, 0, _x1, _y1, _d/64, 1/64, _a, color, 1);
}


- SPLIT draw() method to allow manual surface/shader setup, but make combined function for convenience too


- object pooling - Precreate all potentially needed children and use them, instead of creating and destroying
but does it matter, is it even impactful enough?


- picked color interactions with glow depending on it's brightness
brighter -> wider

- intensity perception varies depending on background, allow to import background into visualizer?


- surface size taken from window size, camera size or perhaps application surface (surface_get_width/height)?
